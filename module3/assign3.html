            Vadodara formerly also known as Baroda is the third largest city in the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of Vadodara District and is located on the banks of the Vishwamitri river, 141 kilometres (88 mi) from the state capital Gandhinagar. The railway line and NH 8 that connect Delhi and Mumbai pass through Vadodara. The city got its name because of the copious amount of Banyan(Vad) Trees present here. The city is also famous as Sanskari Nagari and Kala Nagari (the city of art)[6] of India.

            The city is known for the Lakshmi Vilas Palace, the residence of Baroda State's Maratha royal family, the Gaekwads, of the Gaekwad Dynasty. It is also the home of the Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda.
            After the Maratha defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761,[citation needed] control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose confederacy, and the Gaekwad Maharajas ruled the kingdom until it acceded to Independent Republic of India in 1949. In 1802, the British intervened to defend a Maharaja that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a subsidiary alliance with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a Princely state and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of suzerainty in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered.

            Ahmedabad is the largest city and former capital of the Indian state of Gujarat. It is the administrative headquarters of the Ahmedabad district and the seat of the Gujarat High Court. Ahmedabad's population of 5,633,927 (as per 2011 population census) makes it the fifth-most populous city in India,[8] and the encompassing urban agglomeration population estimated at 6,357,693 is the seventh-most populous in India.[13][14] Ahmedabad is located on the banks of the Sabarmati River, 23 km (14 mi) from the state capital Gandhinagar, which is its twin city.[15]

Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad. A newly-built Sardar Patel Stadium at Motera can accommodate 110,000 spectators . The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction.[16] Ahmedabad's increasing population has resulted in an increase in the construction and housing industries resulting in recent development of skyscrapers.[17]
            
            In 2010, Ahmedabad was ranked third in Forbes's list of fastest growing cities of the decade.[18] In 2012, The Times of India chose Ahmedabad as India's best city to live in.[19] As of 2017, Ahmedabad's estimated gross domestic product was $68 billion (PPP dollars).
